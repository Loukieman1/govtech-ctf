## Frequently Asked Questions

<b>Q: My team qualifies for Category 2, can we opt to compete in Category 1?</b><br>
A: The organising committee will take that request in consideration when verifying the participating category. We will first allocate the team based on the current eligibility first (in this case, Category 2) and note that request. When the dates are closer, we will readjust the eligibility if and only if we have a comfortable pool of participants. This is to ensure a fair competition within each category.

<b>Q: The website states that students in Integrated Programme (IP) are eligible to join. I am currently a Secondary 4 student, but I am not part of IP, am I still eligible to join?</b><br>
A: Yes, for participants under the age of 18, we will need your guardian/parent to fill up the Consent and Indemnity form and submit it to us. The steps are detailed in the registration form.

<b>Q: What if I have more than 4 friends who want to join the competition?</b><br>
A: We strongly encourage you and your friends to divide yourselves into teams of up to 4 members. Please ensure that there is at least one Singapore Citizen/Permanent Resident in the team with a local residential address. The Organising Committee will require each team to comply strictly to this requirement. This is to ensure fair competition play and ease of administration for the CTF. Do note that the top 3 winners from each category will go through a video interview to validate the CTF experience.
