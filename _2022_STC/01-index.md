## What is STACK the Codes?

STACK the Codes 2022 is a Cybersecurity Hackathon that invites the technology community to produce novel solutions to current cybersecurity issues.


## How is STACK the Codes different from other hackathons?

### STC is the first government organized Cybersecurity Hackathon

STC is the first Cybersecurity Hackathon organized by the Singapore Government, and focuses on problem statements relevant to the work of GovTech's Cyber Security Group (For instance, involving areas of Red Teaming, Blue Teaming, Policy Planning, and Operations).

### STC aims to encourage the production of fully functional proof-of-concepts

The development timeframe for submissions is extended from the usual 24 hours to a 30 day timeline.
This encourages the production of a well-functioning Minimum-Viable Product.
The top three winning solutions will also receive continued support after the event to produce fully functional Proof-of-Concepts (PoC), such as technical mentorship from cybersecurity specialists in Cyber Security Group, and potential PoC funding.
