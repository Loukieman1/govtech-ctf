### Why should I join STACK the Codes?

As the first cybersecurity Hackathon organised by the Singapore Government, STACK the Codes offers you a unique insight at the cybersecurity threats the public sector faces. Our problem statements are adapted from this perspective and will involve areas such as Red Teaming, Blue Teaming, Policy Planning, and Operations.

While traditional Hackathons are held over a 24 to 48-hour period, STACK the Codes’ structure and framework will give competitors 30 days to ideate and develop fully functioning Minimum Viable Products. The top 10 teams will be invited to GovTech’s flagship conference, STACK 2022, to present their solutions to a panel of judges from GovTech. Teams with the best solutions stand to earn an opportunity to further develop their solutions under the mentorship of GovTech’s Cyber Security Group to produce a fully functional Proof of Concept.
