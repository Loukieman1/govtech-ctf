## What is STACK the Flags?

STACK the Flags 2020 is an online, jeopardy style Capture-The-Flag competition organised by GovTech Cyber Security Group (CSG). This is an event organised for everyone and anyone! As part of our ongoing effort to engage the technology community, folks from CSG organised our inaugural CTF competition! To top it off, attractive prizes will be awarded to the top teams!

## How to register?

To register for STACK the Flags, form a team of up to **4** members. The only constraint we have is to ensure that there is **1** Singaporean in the team. The rationale is to ease the logistics and administration when we send the prizes over to the winning teams.

Do note that the CTF would require participant's information for administration purposes. Information collected such as educational institution, current employer, are essential to ensure that the participants are categorised fairly.
