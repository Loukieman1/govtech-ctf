## How to register?

To register for STACK the Flags, form a team of up to **4** members. The only constraint we have is to ensure that there is **1** Singaporean in the team. The rationale is to ease the logistics and administration when we send the prizes over to the winning teams.

The registration form will be up soon!

Do note that the CTF would require participant's information for administration purposes. Information collected such as educational institution, current employer, are essential to ensure that the participants are categorised fairly.


## Participation Categories

Each participating team will be categorised into one of the three categories as shown below:

* Category 1 - Open
* Category 2* - Universities and Polytechnics
* Category 3* - Junior Colleges, Integrated Programmes and Institutes of Technical Education

*Note: The category will follow Singapore's educational system for definition. For international students, the CTF administrative team will perform a manual review of the team's categorisation to ensure accurate mapping back to Singapore's educational system.
