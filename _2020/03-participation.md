## Participation Categories

Teams will be placed into one of the three categories:

* Category 1 - Open
* Category 2* - Universities and Polytechnics
* Category 3* - Junior Colleges, Integrated Programmes and Institutes of Technical Education

*Note: The categories are derived from the ones used in Singapore's educational system. 
For international students, the CTF administrative team will perform a manual review for the team's categorisation to ensure accurate benchmarking.

## How will teams be categorised?

If a team member has a placement in an educational institution but has yet to commence (e.g. academic calendar has yet to start), this member will be considered as being enrolled in an educational institution.

If a team member has not received a placement in an educational institution and is currently not enrolled in any educational institution, this member will be considered as being not enrolled in an educational institution.
