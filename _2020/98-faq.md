## Frequently Asked Questions


##### Q: My team qualifies for Category 2, can we opt to compete in Category 1?

A: The organising committee will take that request in consideration when verifying the participating category. We will first allocate the team based on the current eligibility first (in this case, Category 2) and note that request. When the dates are closer, we will readjust the eligibility if and only if we have a comfortable pool of participants. This is to ensure a fair competition within each category.

##### Q: The website states that students in Integrated Programme (IP) are eligible to join. I am currently a Secondary 4 student but I am not part of IP, am I still eligible to join?

A: Yes, for participants under the age of 18, we will need your guardian/parent to fill up the Consent and Indemnity form and submit it to us. The steps are detailed in the registration form.
