## Cheating

The organising committee will not condone cheating at any point in the CTF competition. 
We want to ensure fair play among the participating teams. 
Groups and participants who are found cheating will be disqualified from any prizes and barred from participating in future events.

### Evaluating the winners

A follow-up video conferencing session will be conducted individually with the winning teams of the Top Prizes and Special Awards before the prize ceremony. 

The session is conducted with the following intent:
* Identify authenticity of the CTF experience
* Gather feedback on the CTF
